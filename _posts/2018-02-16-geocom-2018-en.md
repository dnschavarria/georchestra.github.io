The geOcom 2018 event will be hosted this year by The Hauts-de-France Region. All in Amiens to exchange, share, anticipate or discover geOrchestra and its community.

The geOrchestra community meets every year at geOcom. The opportunity to discover new platforms, new players, current or future projects and build the roadmap for the coming year.

This event also allows actors and geomatic curious to discover the community, its operation, uses and issues in progress or to come, not to mention moments of conviviality and discovery of the region.
The geOcom will be followed by two days of sprint and doc sprint code that will put into practice and reserve a time of concrete implementation on the topics selected collectively.

Participation for this event is free. However, we ask you to register via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2yH8xvbKM7fu7VVQDOj5TjXJ7cFZYItmSosfc-RG47AMtEQ/viewform)  to allow you to receive you in the best conditions.
