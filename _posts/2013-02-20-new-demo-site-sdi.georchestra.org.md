<p>We have a dedicated demo siteÂ !</p>
<p>https://sdi.georchestra.org/ will publish modules builds on a regular
basis to review and test the new features. We are using https://sdi.georchestra.org/ci/ continuous integration with
Jenkins to maintain a local repository, to build and deploy the modules and
to perform scheduled tasks. The 8-cores server is operated by the PSC
members.</p>

<p>We also plan to publish nice datasets through sdi.georchestra.org. We
already published the NASA SRTM DEM and the beautiful night 2012 dataset. You
can easily have a look on these datas with the new &quot;predefined contexts&quot;
feature on the demo.</p>
<p>we hope that sdi.georchestra.org will be a full scale spatial data
infrastructure with open datas and usable webservices.</p>
